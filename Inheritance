- inheritance is the process in which a class takes on the attributes and methods of another (is-a relationship)
  - example:   Toyota is a Vehicle class
  - syntax: class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
      where DerivedClass is the new class you're making and 
      BaseClass is the class from which that new class inherits.
      
- Sample code:
  class Customer(object):
    """Produces objects that represent customers."""
    def __init__(self, customer_id):
        self.customer_id = customer_id

    def display_cart(self):
        print "I'm a string that stands in for the contents of your shopping cart!"

  class ReturningCustomer(Customer):
    """For customers of the repeat variety."""
    def display_order_history(self):
        print "I'm a string that stands in for your order history!"

  monty_python = ReturningCustomer("ID: 12345")
  monty_python.display_cart()
  monty_python.display_order_history()
  
  Output: 
  I'm a string that stands in for the contents of your shopping cart!
  I'm a string that stands in for your order history!
